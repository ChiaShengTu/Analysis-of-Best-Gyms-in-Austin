# Group 2 Midterm Project Report

## Goal

The main goal of our project is to analyze reviews of different gyms in Austin using google map API and Natural Language Processor. As much as we love our beloved Gregory gym on campus, we can't use it once we graduate from this program. So we thought it would be a cool idea to use some of the tools we learned in class and also some new ones to see which gyms in Austin have good reviews and also the reasons behind good ratings.
